# CourseWare Agent Execution Rules

## General Overview

All agents in the system must obey the following global execution and coordination rules. These rules ensure uninterrupted execution, proper handoff, and isolated context integrity between agents.

---

## 1. Continuous Execution Until Project Completion

The agent system must continue running without termination until the entire project is considered complete.

- A project is complete when **all tasks in Linear are marked as Done**, and
- The final project report has been generated and stored.

---

## 2. Context Reset Between Agents

After a new agent has been invoked and execution switches:

- All previous chat context, memory, and history must be discarded.
- The new agent must start with a **fresh context** based on its current role and assigned task.

This ensures strict isolation between agents and avoids cross-agent contamination.

---

## 3. Agent Handoff Routing

Once any agent completes its role and calls `handoffToDispatcher`:

- The Dispatcher Agent MUST consult the `AgentsCommons.md` file.
- Log of all dispatches in `logs/DISPATCHES_LOGS.md`
- Based on the task type, agent status, and documented agent responsibilities, the Dispatcher selects the next agent accordingly.

---

## 4. Agent Bootstrapping from Definitions

Before invoking any agent, the Dispatcher MUST:

- Read that agentâ€™s role-specific protocol file located in `agents/`
  (e.g. `architect.md`, `qa.md`, etc).
- The agent must operate strictly according to its documented scope, authority, and expected behavior.

---

## 4.1 Role-Specific Protocol Enforcement

When any agent is activated:

- It MUST load and initialize the definition and behavior documented in its protocol file within the `./agents/` directory.
- These files define valid commands, scope of authority, input/output structures, and external call permissions.
- The agent must **not act beyond** the responsibilities or methods defined in its own role protocol.
- If the corresponding protocol file is missing, execution must halt and control must return to the Dispatcher with a configuration error message.

---

## Compliance

All agents are responsible for maintaining strict adherence to these rules. Any deviation may result in invalid task execution and system rollback to the Dispatcher.
